/**
  * Function trait which embodies the behavior of a lazy, three-way comparison.
  *
  * The problem with the Java style of comparing, which Scala also uses, is that you cannot easily compose
  * comparisons. A typical comparison of two quantities compares the two most significant quantities, then,
  * if the objects appear different, the result is returned; otherwise the result of the comparison of the
  * less significant quantities is returned. This requires saving the value of the first comparison in a (final) variable.
  * But yuck!
  *
  * Although it would be possible to write this eagerly, or simply replace it with an Option[Boolean],
  * there is some slight advantage in defining it lazily.
  * In many situations we use pattern-matching rather than evaluation of the Comparison value.
  *
  * NOTE: also that Comparison is a form of three-valued logic.
  * which does not correspond exactly to the the indeterminate state.
  * We can generate a Kleenean object by invoking the Comparison's apply method.
  *
  * This trait is sealed because there can only be two concrete sub-types.
